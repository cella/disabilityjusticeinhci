        <li>Disability justice in the Global South</li>
        <li>Tensions in academia and disability justice</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We invite researchers, designers, practitioners, activists, and community members to submit materials that reflect their interest in the aforementioned topics. These materials may be one of the following:</p>

      <p>Accepted submissions will be featured on the workshopâ€™s website. Per SIGCHI requirements, at least one author of each accepted submission must attend the workshop and all participants must register for both the workshop and for at least one day of the CHI 2022 conference.</p>
      <p><strong>All submissions must be accessible</strong>. This means that documents must be screen reader accessible, images must be described with alt text or narration, documents and videos should use high contrast colors and readable fonts, jargon should be defined in plain language, and audio should be captioned. There are other accessibility considerations we have not listed here; please refer to our <a href="#resources">resources</a> section with detailed instructions on how to make various submissions accessible, and consider what you will need to do to make your unique submission accessible. Please reach out to <a href="organizers@disabilityjusticeinhci.org">organizers@disabilityjusticeinhci.org</a> if the resources do not answer your questions.</p>
